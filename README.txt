This program converts a SQLite database (with a predefined scheme) to a valid HTML file. It uses a HTML template file for the output.
At this moment this program and the documentation is only available in German and very project specific.

It is designed for a part of the website "vulgaererspiegel.bplaced.net", but it can be rewritten for other projects and it will be more generalized in the future.
